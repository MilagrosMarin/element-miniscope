    "Welcome to the tutorial for the DataJoint Element for Miniscope Calcium Imaging. This\n",

    "- **Automation**: Instead of manually inserting data into each table, which can be error-prone and time-consuming, `populate()` automates the insertion based on the dependencies and relationships already established in the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependency Resolution**: Before populating a table, `populate()` ensures all its dependencies are populated. This maintains the integrity and consistency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part Tables**: If a table has part tables associated with it, calling `populate()` on the main table will also populate its part tables. This is especially useful in cases like `ephys.EphysRecording` and its part table `ephys.EphysRecording.EphysFile`, as they are closely linked in terms of data lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Restriction**: The `populate()` method can be restricted to specific entries. For instance, by providing a `session_key`, we're ensuring the method only operates on the data relevant to that particular session. This is both efficient and avoids unnecessary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming cells, we'll make use of the `populate()` method to fill the `miniscope.MiniscopeRecordingInfo` table and its part table. Remember, while this operation is automated, it's essential to understand the underlying logic to ensure accurate and consistent data entry.\n"

    "pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will do some exploratory analysis by fetching the data from the database and creating a few plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Querying Data\n",
    "\n",
    "DataJoint provides a powerful querying system, allowing you to retrieve and work with data stored in your database seamlessly. In this section, we'll explore the fundamental querying concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Query?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A query is essentially a request for data. With DataJoint, you can craft specific queries to fetch data that meets your criteria from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `fetch()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- The primary method for retrieving data from a DataJoint table is `fetch()`.\n",
    "- **Default Behavior**: Without any arguments, `fetch()` returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds to an entry in the table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### The `fetch1()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- For tables with a single entry or when you're only interested in the first entry, use `fetch1()`.\n",
    "- **Default Behavior**: It returns a dictionary of attributes for that one entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both `fetch()` and `fetch1()` can be made more specific by providing attributes.\n",
    "- Example: `fetch1('fps')` will retrieve only the `fps` attribute from the first entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restricting Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often, you don't want to fetch everything. Instead, you might want data related to a specific subject or session.\n",
    "- DataJoint uses the `&` operator to restrict queries.\n",
    "- Example: To get all session times for `subject5`, you might use:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  subject1_times = (session.Session & \"subject = 'subject1'\").fetch(\"session_datetime\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fetching Primary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, you just need the primary keys of entries.\n",
    "- Use the `fetch(\"KEY\")` syntax for this. For instance, `(session.Session).fetch(\"KEY\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's Dive In!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've established the basics, let's delve deeper into querying with some practical examples."
